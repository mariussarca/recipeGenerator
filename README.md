Here‚Äôs a detailed **README.md** for your Recipe Generator project:  


# Recipe Generator  

## Description  
The Recipe Generator is a simple web application built with **React** that helps users create recipes based on the ingredients they input. Users can add ingredients to a list, and the app generates a recipe by calling an AI-based API.  

## Features  
- Add ingredients one by one to the list.  
- Generate a recipe based on the list of ingredients.  
- Easy-to-use form with live feedback.  

## Project Structure  
The app is divided into multiple components:  
1. **Main Component**:  
   - Handles user interactions such as adding ingredients and fetching the recipe.  
2. **IngredientList Component**:  
   - Displays the list of added ingredients and includes the button to generate the recipe.  
3. **ClaudeRecipe Component**:  
   - Displays the recipe generated by the AI in a formatted way.  
4. **Header Component**:  
   - Contains the app title and any additional navigation or branding.  

## Technologies Used  
- **React**: For building the user interface.  
- **JavaScript**: For logic and functionality.  
- **CSS**: For styling the app.  

## Setup  
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js installed on your computer.  
- A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.  

### Installation  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd recipe-generator
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  

4. Update the AI API:  
   - Open the `callAI.js` file located in the `src` directory.  
   - Replace the placeholder API call `getRecipeFromMistral` with your own implementation to connect to the desired AI service.  

5. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5137` to view the app.  

## How to Use  
1. Add ingredients by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add ingredient" button.  
2. Once you‚Äôve added all desired ingredients, click the "Generate Recipe" button.  
3. View the generated recipe in the app.  

## Customization  
### Modifying the API Call  
To integrate a different AI API for recipe generation:  
1. Update the `getRecipeFromMistral` function in the `callAI.js` file.  
2. Ensure the new API call matches the expected return format of the recipe as a markdown string.  

### Styling  
You can customize the look and feel of the app by modifying the CSS files or adding your own styles.
